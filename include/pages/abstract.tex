\chapter{Abstract}

The research into direct memory access in the userspace has increased over the latest years especially in the field of virtualization. The main reason for this is the need for high performance and low latency in virtualized environments.
The hardware that enables this is called the IOMMU. Through the IOMMU, the guest operating system can directly access the hardware without the need for the hypervisor to intervene.
This technology is not bound to only virtualization, but can also be used for high-performance userspace drivers.
To test the effect of the IOMMU on user space I/O, we implement IOMMU support on the userspace NVMe driver vroom using the Linux framework VFIO and a modern augment IOMMUFD. VFIO enables direct memory access from userspace.
We show that it is possible to attain the same performance as directly accessing memory with physical addresses, while also increasing security.
