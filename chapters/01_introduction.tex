The IOMMU was first implemented as a way to increase address space for 32-bit devices.
After almost every device was using 64-bit addresses, the IOMMUs purpose shifted to providing a layer of isolation between devices and the CPU. \cite{OLS2007}
The isolation layer prevents devices from accessing memory that they are not allowed to access.
An additional benefit of the IOMMU is that root privileges are not needed to access memory.
We demonstrate the effects of using the IOMMU by implementing it on the NVMe driver vroom. \cite{vroom}
We use Rust to implement the driver and the userspace application as it offers high performance and memory safety without garbage collection.
The IOMMU used in this thesis is an Intel IOMMU using the VT-d extension.
