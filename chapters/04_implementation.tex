\chapter{Implementation} \label{c:impl}

\section{syscalls}
A variety of syscalls are used in the process of allocation and mapping. The syscalls that are used by vroom are mmap, ioctl, pread, pwrite (and mlock for the non IOMMU version). While there are crates that implement the syscall functionality, we only use the \texttt{libc} crate to avoid inflating the dependency list and executable size. As these require C-like syntax and an unsafe block in Rust, wrapper macros are used to provide locality of behaviour and secure error handling. In \autoref{lst:mmapmacro} the macro for the mmap syscall can be seen.
As part of our error handling, we introduce an error enum variant for each syscall. To not hide the inherit unsafety of these macros, we add the suffix "\_unsafe".

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust,caption={Syscall \texttt{mmap} macro, with own error variant}, label=lst:mmapmacro]
    #[macro_export]
    macro_rules! mmap_unsafe {
        ($addr:expr, $len:expr, $prot:expr, $flags:expr, $fd:expr, $offset:expr) => {{
            let ptr = unsafe { libc::mmap($addr, $len, $prot, $flags, $fd, $offset) };
            if ptr == libc::MAP_FAILED {
                Err(Error::Mmap {
                    error: (format!("Mmap with len {} failed", $len)),
                    io_error: (std::io::Error::last_os_error()),
                })
            } else {
                Ok(ptr)
            }
        }};
    } 
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Virtual Function I/O}
Virtual Function I/O (VFIO) is an IOMMU agnostic framework for exposing devices to userspace. VFIO consists of two parts, the \texttt{vfio-pci} driver and an IOMMU API. The IOMMU API can either be the type1 IOMMU API for x86 architectures or the SPAPR IOMMU API for ppc64 architectures. We will only use the type1 IOMMU API. The VFIO PCI driver can be bound to a PCI device. This allows using \texttt{mmap(2)} to map the PCI device registers into memory. The type1 VFIO IOMMU API is used for mapping and unmapping address translations in the IOMMU. Alternatively, the IOMMUFD API can be used instead of the container API, which currently is not feature complete, but will eventually replace the container-based solution \cite{vfiokerneldocs}. The layers of VFIO can be seen on \autoref{fig:layer-vfio}.

To use the IOMMU we need to initialize the IOMMU, VFIO, DMA and the NVMe device:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{\nameref{sec:bindvfiopci}}: Before initializing the devices, the NVMe device needs to be unbound from the kernel driver and bound to \texttt{vfio-pci}.
    \item \textbf{\nameref{sec:iommuinit}}: As the first step of the actual driver, we need to initialize the IOMMU. This is done using the VFIO IOMMU API, which is an interface for the IOMMU driver. We can get the container file descriptor with VFIO. The group needs to be assigned to the container. In this step we also can attain the device file descriptor, which can be used to read/write/\texttt{mmap} the device and PCIe registers through the IOMMU.
    \item \textbf{\nameref{sec:pcieconfig}}: Using the device fd, we can enable DMA by setting a bit in the PCIe command register.
    \item \textbf{\nameref{sec:nvmeinit}}: We use \texttt{mmap} to map the NVMe base address register into memory for configuring the NVMe device.
    \item \textbf{\nameref{sec:dmamapping}}: Using \texttt{mmap}, we can either map a file into the virtual address space or allocate space in memory. Using the container fd, we can create a mapping in the IOMMU, and therefore exposing it to the NVMe controller for DMA.
\end{enumerate}

Communication with the VFIO interface works by using ioctl system calls.
While there is Rust's extensive \texttt{libc} library providing the system calls \texttt{ioctl} and \texttt{mmap} and their flags, the Linux \texttt{vfio.h} constants and structs need to either be defined manually or with a crate like bindgen, which automates bindings for C and C++ libraries \cite{cratebindgen}. To keep the binary and dependency list as small as possible we chose the manual implementation.

\subsection{Regions}
Using regions, we can directly mmap device memory into host memory for easy access to the NVMe controller.
VFIO provides structs for using mmap to directly map the NVMe device into memory. Using \texttt{VFIO\_DEVICE\_GET\_REGION\_INFO} we can attain the length and the offset needed for mmap.

\subsection{Groups and Containers}
VFIO uses group to distinguish between groups of devices which can be isolated from the host system. In the ideal case, every device would only be part of one group in order to increase security by providing single-device isolation. Groups are the smallest unit size on a system to ensure secure user access.
To further reduce overhead from the IOMMU Containers are used in VFIO, which can hold multiple groups. These containers can be used to ease translation and reduce TLB page faults.

\subsection{Binding NVMe to \texttt{vfio-pci}}\label{sec:bindvfiopci}
To use the IOMMU for the driver, we first need to initialize the VFIO kernel module and bind the VFIO driver to the NVMe device.
As this binds the driver to a device, it has to be run with root privileges.
By changing the owner of the VFIO container to an unprivileged user, the driver can use the VFIO driver to interact with the device without root.
In \autoref{lst:vfioinit} the initialization script for the Vfio driver is shown.

% maybe take vfio_bind function
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,caption={\texttt{vfio-pci} binding function in bash}, label=lst:vfiobind, frame=single]
    function vfio_bind {
        nvme_address=$1
        device_path="/sys/bus/pci/devices/$nvme_address"

        echo "vfio-pci" > "$device_path/driver_override"

        if [[ -d $device_path ]]; then
            curr_driver=$(readlink $device_path/driver)
            curr_driver=${curr_driver##*/}

            if [[ $curr_driver != "vfio-pci" ]]; then
                echo $nvme_address > "$device_path/driver/unbind"
            fi
        fi

        echo $nvme_address > /sys/bus/pci/drivers_probe
    }
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,caption={Initializing \texttt{vfio-pci} using \texttt{vfio\_bind} from \autoref{lst:vfiobind} and setting permissions}, label=lst:vfioinit, frame=single]
    #!/bin/bash
    
    modprobe vfio-pci
    vfio_bind "0000:03:00.0"
    chown $user:$group /dev/vfio/*
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Add VFIO kernel module using \texttt{modprobe}
    \item Unbind the PCI device from other drivers and bind it to \texttt{vfio-pci}
    \item Set VFIO group permissions to user/group using \texttt{chown}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{IOMMU initialization}\label{sec:iommuinit}
To initialize the IOMMU, we first need to get the container file descriptor. The container is accessible under the path \texttt{/dev/vfio/vfio}. Using the raw container file descriptor, we can use the following \texttt{ioctl} calls:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust, caption={\texttt{ioctl} calls needed for IOMMU initialization}, label=lst:containerioctls]
    ioctl_unsafe!(container_fd, VFIO_GET_API_VERSION)
    ioctl_unsafe!(container_fd, VFIO_CHECK_EXTENSION, VFIO_TYPE1_IOMMU)
    ioctl_unsafe!(group_fd, VFIO_GROUP_GET_STATUS, &group_status)
    ioctl_unsafe!(group_fd, VFIO_GROUP_SET_CONTAINER, &container_fd)
    ioctl_unsafe!(container_fd, VFIO_SET_IOMMU, VFIO_TYPE1_IOMMU)
    ioctl_unsafe!(group_fd, VFIO_GROUP_GET_DEVICE_FD, pci_addr)
    ioctl_unsafe!(container_fd, VFIO_IOMMU_GET_INFO, &iommu_info)   
\end{lstlisting}

Excluding the Status and Info calls, the functionality consists of initialising the IOMMU for the device groups by setting the container on the groups, enabling Type1 for the IOMMU and fetching the device file descriptor. With the device file descriptor, we gain access to the device regions through the VFIO device API, allowing us to \texttt{mmap} the NVMe BAR into memory. Using \texttt{VFIO\_IOMMU\_GET\_INFO} we can see the supported pagesizes. As our IOMMU supports 4K, 2M and 1G pagesizes the field iova\_pgsizes has the value 0x40201000.

\subsection{PCIe configuration}\label{sec:pcieconfig}
To enable DMA we need to set a bit in the PCIe device registers. % todo check this 
This is done in the command register of the PCIe configuration space.


\subsection{NVMe initialization}\label{sec:nvmeinit}
Using the Vfio, the initialization process of the NVMe SSD works as followed.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Map the NVMe device memory into host memory using VFIO resource info.
    \item Allocate Admin SQ, CQ and I/O SQ, CQ
    \item Create a mapping on the IOMMU using VFIO
    \item Configure the NVMe device
    \item Pass I/O Queue addresses to NVMe device using admin queues
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{DMA (Un-)Mapping}\label{sec:dmamapping}
In order to provide a section of memory on which the device can perform DMA operations, the user needs to either allocate some memory in the processes address space or map an existing file into the process virtual address space. This can be achieved by using the Linux syscall \texttt{mmap}. Using \texttt{mmap}'s flags we can also define the page size used. The \texttt{MAP\_HUGETLB} flag is used in conjunction with the \texttt{MAP\_HUGE\_2MB} and \texttt{MAP\_HUGE\_1GB} flags for 2MiB and 1 GiB pages respectively. By default \texttt{mmap} uses the default page size of 4KiB.
The main IOMMU work is done by then creating the map struct \texttt{vfio\_iommu\_type1\_dma\_map}. We set the DMA mapping to read and write, and provide the same IOVA as the Virtual address. By then passing it to an ioctl call with the according VFIO operation \texttt{VFIO\_IOMMU\_MAP\_DMA} we can create a mapping in the page tables of the IOMMU. This way we can give the IOVA to the NVMe controller, which it will use to access the memory through the address translation of the IOMMU.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust,caption={Mapping memory for DMA}, label=lst:mapdma]
    let mut iommu_dma_map = vfio_iommu_type1_dma_map {
        argsz: mem::size_of::<vfio_iommu_type1_dma_map>() as u32,
        flags: IoctlFlag::VFIO_DMA_MAP_FLAG_READ 
                | IoctlFlag::VFIO_DMA_MAP_FLAG_WRITE,
        vaddr: ptr as u64,
        iova: ptr as u64,
        size,
    };

    ioctl_unsafe!(
        *container_fd,
        IoctlOperation::VFIO_IOMMU_MAP_DMA,
        &mut iommu_dma_map
    )?;

    let iova = iommu_dma_map.iova as usize; 
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Unmapping DMA}
Unmapping DMA happens when the process exits, yet for performance and application reasons we implement the unmap\_dma function which can be used to unmap a DMA. Using the \texttt{VFIO\_IOMMU\_UNMAP\_DMA} \texttt{ioctl} operation we can unmap the memory, and finally free it by using \texttt{munmap}.

\subsection{I/O operations with VFIO}
After initialization, the NVMe is ready to use. A sequential, single-threaded I/O operation is shown in \autoref{fig:vroom-graph}.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/vroomdiagram.pdf}
    \caption{I/O operation using vroom with enabled IOMMU}
    \label{fig:vroom-graph}
\end{figure}
The sequence of events are as followed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{I/O function call:} The application calls a read/write method on vroom
    \item \textbf{Command Submission:} Vroom creates a \texttt{NvmeCommand} struct and places it on the Submission Queue head.
    \item \textbf{Ring SQ Doorbell:} Vroom places the submission queue head address in the doorbell register. The doorbell register is part of the NVMe BAR region, which is mapped to memory.
    \item \textbf{Take Command:} The NVMe takes the command from the SQ.
    \item \textbf{Perform I/O:} The NVMe uses the IOMMU to access the host memory via DMA and performs the read/write command.
    \item \textbf{Complete I/O:} The NVMe places a \texttt{NvmeCompletion} struct instance on the head of the Completion Queue.
    \item \textbf{Polled CQ:} By polling the CQ, vroom can process the CQ entry.
    \item \textbf{Ring CQ Doorbell:} After processing the CQ entry, vroom rings the CQ Doorbell to notify the NVMe controller that the Completion Queue has been processed.
    \item \textbf{Notify Application:} Vroom notifies the Application of the success of the I/O operation. The application can continue running.
\end{enumerate}

\section{IOMMUFD}
The IOMMU File Descriptor user API (IOMMUFD) offers a way of controlling the IOMMU subsystem using file descriptors in user-space \cite{iommufdkerneldocs}. It replaces the VFIO IOMMU API using containers with the IOMMUFD API.
It allows management of I/O address spaces (IOAS), enabling mapping user space memory on the IOMMU.
IOMMUFD has only been recently added to the Linux Kernel in December 2022. E.g. Debian 12 does not include it, Fedora 40 does, but it is not enabled in the kernel configuration. Considering that it is not widely available or enabled on many distributions, our driver offers both options of using the IOMMU. The performance tests are done using the 'legacy' VFIO container way.
The device file descriptor, which was previously attained with \texttt{VFIO\_GROUP\_GET\_DEVICE\_FD} can now be gotten through opening the character device /dev/vfio/devices/vfioX.
By using this character device pointer we can claim the ownership over the VFIO device. That way VFIO does not rely on group/container/iommu drivers.
I/O Address Spaces (IOAS) are the equivalent to a VFIO container in legacy VFIO.
