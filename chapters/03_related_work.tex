\section{Storage Performance Development Kit}
The Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK) provides ``a collection of tools and libraries for writing high performance, scalable, user-mode storage applications'' \cite{spdkindex}. It includes an user-space NVMe driver which is fast and production-ready. While this driver supports the use of the driver without the IOMMU, the SPDK Documentation recommends using the IOMMU as using VFIO and the IOMMU is the "future proof...long-term foundation" for SPDK \cite{spdkmemory}.
