\section{Data Plane Development Kit}
The Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) is a framework for developing user-space network card drivers. It allows for high performance network applications. It can either run using direct memory access with physical addresses or using VFIO \cite{aboutdpdk}. DPDK offers polling drivers for a variety of network cards.
It is one of the most successful projects in the world of userspace drivers and has influenced many advances in the IOMMU space.

\section{Storage Performance Development Kit}
The demand for high-speed userspace drivers in storage applications inspired the development of the Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK). SPDK uses some shared libraries and architecture with DPDK. Especially through the wide adoption of the NVMe protocol and the standardization of said protocol, only one driver for all NVMe SSDs has to be developed.
NVMe is a storage protocol which is widely used, modern and highly performant. Therefore it is a protocol for which many drivers have been written, including userspace drivers. The Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK) provides ``a collection of tools and libraries for writing high performance, scalable, user-mode storage applications'' \cite{spdkindex}. It includes an user-space NVMe driver which is fast and production-ready. While this driver supports the use of the driver without the IOMMU, the SPDK Documentation recommends using the IOMMU as using VFIO and the IOMMU is the "future proof...long-term foundation" for SPDK \cite{spdkmemory}. Even though SPDK is the established userspace NVMe driver option, the drawbacks include its high complexity even for simple applications, as well as it being written in C.

% \section{ixy} \label{s:ixy}
% Ixy is a user space network driver for network interface cards. In the worst case a packet is 64 Bytes long and two packets fit on one 4K Page. In their implementation of IOMMU support a performance decrease of up to 75\% \cite{iommuhuber}.
