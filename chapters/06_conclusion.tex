\chapter{Conclusion}

In this thesis, we improved vroom's safety by implementing IOMMU support. We come to the same conclusion as SPDK. The advantages of using the VFIO such as variable page support by not using page pinning as well as the ability to run the driver without root privileges overweigh the small performance impact that can be registered in niche cases. Considering that IOMMU technology has seen a rise in popularity in the use of hardware passtrough for virtualization it is also likely that in the future the IOMMU performance and the IOTLB size will increase, further closing the gap. The ability to improve security drastically and increasing address space, while not compromising on performance are the reason the MMU succeeded, and it is likely that the IOMMU will as well. Now, that we have achieved in-process safety using Rust and improved security through using the IOMMU, the next step would be to implement an own VFIO/IOMMUFD alternative written in Rust, to also achieve memory-safety on the kernelspace side of the driver.
